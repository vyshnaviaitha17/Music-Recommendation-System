### About
This repository demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for real-time Facial emotion recognition application along with reccommending music based on detected emotions.
Done in three steps:
1. Face Detection: from the video source using OpenCV.
2. Emotion Recognition: using a model trained by using Mediapipe library.
3. Music Recommendation: Using detected emotion to create a search query on Youtube

The model is trained for 50 epochs and runs at 87% accuracy.

### Dependencies
This project depends on Python and following packages which can be easily installed through `requirements.txt` file by running the following command:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Python 3.9.6
- pip 22.1.1
- streamlit 1.9.1
- streamlit-webrtc 0.37.0
- opencv-python 4.5.5.64
- mediapipe 0.8.10
 
### Instructions
#### Testing Locally
-	Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies.
-	`cd ./moosic`
-	`streamlit run app.py`
-	The app is now running at http://localhost:8501
-	While testing, wait for the model to detect your emotions and click on recommend button to get songs based on a particular emotion
- Emotion used previously are stored as cache and might cause an error in recommending music, delete `detected_emotion.npy file` in the directory to resolve this. 
- Recommended music is loaded in next tab as a youtube search query.

### System Architechture

### Repository Structure
 This repository is organised as:
 - [app](/app.py) This file contain the setup of final web app.
 - [model](/model.h5) This file contains the trained model.
 - [Emotion Detection](./Emotion%20Detection) This folder contains python scripts to train the model.
 - [.streamlit](./.streamlit) This folder contains configuration files for the streamlit theme in Web App.




### Future Scope
- Deploying the web app.
- Integration of an inbuilt music player using  SpotiPy library, with spotify authentication.
- Addition of more gestures, and control of volume using gesture detection.
- Improved Reliablity and addition of User Feedback
